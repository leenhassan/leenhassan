# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Leen, a Health Informatics student with a passion for improving healthcare systems using technology. I'm dedicated to learning and creating innovative solutions that bridge the gap between technology and healthcare.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Developing healthcare-related applications such as the **MEDtech Heart App** and **EHR Information System**.
- Exploring more about **data analytics**, **machine learning** in healthcare, and **electronic health records** (EHR).

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Advanced concepts in **Health Informatics**, **data management**, and **digital health solutions**.
- **Python**, **Flask**, **SQL**, and **machine learning algorithms** to solve healthcare-related problems.

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- **Health Informatics**, **EHR Systems**, and how technology is transforming the healthcare industry.
- **Flask**, **Python**, **MySQL**, and building real-time data processing systems.

## ðŸ“« How to reach me:
- **Email**: leenhassan31@gmail.com

## âš¡ Fun fact:
- Iâ€™m always eager to explore how health data can be harnessed for smarter, more efficient healthcare solutions.

Feel free to check out my projects below:

### [MEDtech Heart App](https://github.com/leenhassan/MEDtech)
A heart rate monitoring system integrated with Arduino ECG sensors, focusing on real-time data analysis and alerting.

### [EHR Information System](https://github.com/leenhassan/ehr-information-system)
A system for managing patient and doctor records with an intuitive interface to optimize data flow and usability.

Thanks for visiting! I'm excited to connect with others in the tech and healthcare industry. ðŸ™Œ
